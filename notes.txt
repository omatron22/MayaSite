=== Questions for Noah - Roboflow Import ===

Date: Dec 12, 2025

Successfully imported 705/714 instances from Roboflow dataset.

9 instances were skipped due to ID mismatches:
1. "la no ajaw" - No numeric Bonn ID to parse
2. "1999st yi" - Bonn ID 1999 not found in LMGG concordance
3. "T255 ma" - Thompson ID (T255) not Bonn format
4. "1999 alay" - Bonn ID 1999 not found in LMGG concordance

Questions:
- Are these valid signs that should be in the catalog?
- Should we add Bonn 1999 manually, or is it a non-standard ID?
- How should we handle Thompson IDs (T-prefix) vs Bonn IDs?
- Are compound glyphs like "la no ajaw" meant to be stored differently?

Current match rate: 98.7% (705/714)
